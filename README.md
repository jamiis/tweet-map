A live tweet map using AWS's DynamoDB, Elastic Beanstalk, and Elastic Load Balancer.
Also, the Google Maps javascript API, Node, Express, and web sockets.

It was deployed for a time on AWS but currently not live because of 
AWS fees and a limit on Alchemy API calls. I will eventually fix this 
and get it deployed on DigitalOcean, possibly with sentiment analysis removed.
